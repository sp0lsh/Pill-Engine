## Overview

This is the backbone of [wgpu-3dgs-viewer](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu-3dgs-viewer) and [wgpu-3dgs-editor](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu-3dgs-editor).

This library provides helper functions and abstractions for working with 3D Gaussian Splatting, including:
- Loading and parsing PLY files containing 3D Gaussian data.
- Configuring Gaussian structures for loading into GPU buffers.
- Utilities for creating and managing GPU resources related to 3D Gaussian Splatting.
- Compute pipeline abstractions for processing 3D Gaussian data on the GPU.

## Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/LioQing/wgpu-3dgs-core/tree/master/examples) directory for usage examples.
